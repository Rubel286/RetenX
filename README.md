📌 Project Overview
RetenX is a Machine Learning-based Employee Attrition Prediction System designed to help organizations analyze employee retention trends. It uses multiple ML algorithms to predict which employees are at risk of leaving, enabling businesses to take proactive measures.


Features

✅ Predict employee attrition using 5 ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, XGBoost).

✅ Handle datasets with null values for better accuracy.

✅ User-friendly Flask web interface for predictions and analysis.

✅ Clean and modern UI inspired by x.ai.

✅ Comparison of different ML models' performance.

✅ Dataset processing for bulk employee attrition prediction.

✅ Historical trends & retention strategy suggestions based on insights.
